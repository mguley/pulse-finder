# Name for the service, which helps identify it in logs or service management tools.
Description=Auth gRPC server

Requires=network-online.target
After=network-online.target

# Configure service start rate limiting.
# If the service is (re)started more than 5 times in 600 seconds, then don't permit it to start anymore.
StartLimitIntervalSec=600
# Limits the number of times the service can restart within the time window (600 seconds).
StartLimitBurst=5

[Service]
# Specifies that the service should be started by executing the binary directly.
Type=simple
# The service will run as the `pulsefinder` user, ensuring that it doesn't run as root.
User=pulsefinder
# The service will run with the `pulsefinder` group permissions.
Group=pulsefinder
# Load environment variables from the /etc/environment file.
EnvironmentFile=/etc/environment
# Working directory for the server. Any relative paths will be based on this directory.
WorkingDirectory=/opt/auth-grpc-server
# Command to start the Auth gRPC server.
ExecStart=/opt/auth-grpc-server/auth-grpc-server-o

# Security hardening options
# Disallows the service from gaining new privileges through exec().
NoNewPrivileges=yes
# Provides a private /tmp and /var/tmp directories for the service.
PrivateTmp=yes
# Mounts /usr, /boot, and /etc as read-only, restricting write access.
ProtectSystem=full
# Prevents the service from accessing user home directories.
ProtectHome=yes
# Isolates the service's user and group database to a minimal set, enhancing security.
PrivateUsers=yes
# Protects kernel tunable settings from being altered by the service.
ProtectKernelTunables=yes
# Restricts access to control groups, preventing the service from manipulating them.
ProtectControlGroups=yes
# Restricts the service to use only specified address families (network protocols).
RestrictAddressFamilies=AF_INET AF_INET6 AF_UNIX
# Removes specific capabilities (e.g., debugging other processes) from the service.
CapabilityBoundingSet=~CAP_SYS_PTRACE
# Denies the service the ability to create writable and executable memory mappings.
MemoryDenyWriteExecute=yes

# Standard output/error handling
# Directs standard output to the systemd journal.
StandardOutput=journal
# Directs standard error to the systemd journal.
StandardError=journal

# Resource limits
# Sets the maximum number of open files (increase if your service handles many connections).
LimitNOFILE=10240
# Sets the maximum number of processes the service can create.
LimitNPROC=512

# Ensure all child processes are terminated when the service stops.
KillMode=control-group

# Automatically restart the service after a 5-second wait if it exits with a non-zero exit code.
Restart=on-failure
# If the service fails, systemd will wait 5 seconds before restarting it.
RestartSec=5
# Sets the time to wait for the service to stop before systemd forcibly kills it (graceful shutdown).
TimeoutStopSec=20

[Install]
# Start the service automatically at boot time when the system reaches the multi-user target (non-graphical multi-user system).
WantedBy=multi-user.target
